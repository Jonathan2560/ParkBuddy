This is the final project that I created with paulinevr at the end of my bootcamp @ Le Wagon. It's a mobile website that allows people to find parking opportunities in the city (like in Brussels), by allowing them to rent parking spots in front of people's garages. The site also allows users to rent out their own parking spot in front of their garage. It's built in ruby on rails and has a lot of gems implemented for different functionalities. For example: Stripe, Geocode, Mapbox, Money-Rails and rqr-code. Don't hesitate to check it out!
